Part I: Implementing request handling methods for the transaction handler

The transaction handler has access to the following objects:

self._lock_table: the global lock table. More information in the README.

self._acquired_locks: a list of locks acquired by the transaction. Used to
release locks when the transaction commits or aborts. This list is initially
empty.

self._desired_lock: the lock that the transaction is waiting to acquire as well
as the operation to perform. This is initialized to None.

self._xid: this transaction's ID. You may assume each transaction is assigned a
unique transaction ID.

self._store: the in-memory key-value store. You may refer to kvstore.py for
methods supported by the store.

self._undo_log: a list of undo operations to be performed when the transaction
is aborted. The undo operation is a tuple of the form (@key, @value). This list
is initially empty.

You may assume that the key/value inputs to these methods are already type-
checked and are valid.

        choice is deterministic. For example, if transactions 1 and 2 form a
